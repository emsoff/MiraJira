MiraJira
========

A PHP wrapper for the Jira API. I chose the most useful endpoints for my own needs and skipped the rest. Shouldn't be hard for someone to come up with the remaining endpoints, as the API itself is well-developed and accessible. 

For the curious, mira is "look, sight" in Spanish, and it rhymes with Jira.
